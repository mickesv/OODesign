<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I am going to address the user stories in this sprint from two different perspectives. Both of them backs up to how <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a> described a pattern language for architectures (as used e.g. by Gamma et al. in the Design Pattern book). The first perspective is the common and widely used idea of architectural styles and architectural patterns as a design template. For example, if I describe a system as having a &ldquo;Layered Architecture&rdquo;, being a &ldquo;Pipes and Filters system&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;Model-View-Controller&rdquo; architecture, this means that the basic structure of the architecture is done according to these patterns. They can be described as ready-made solutions that describe the overall structure of your system, along with the roles and responsibilities of each component. This is the approach taken e.g. by Buschmann et al. (1996)
</p>

<p>
The <i>second</i> perspective is the one that Bass et al. (2012) uses, where they describe patterns as specific building blocks that you use for specific purposes, and thus your overall architecture is composed by these smaller building blocks. They refer to these blocks as <i>Architecture Tactics</i>. The two perspectives are not mutually exclusive. You are likely to start with an overall architecture pattern to setup a <i>potential</i> for achieving a certain blend of quality requirements. As you continue to design your architecture, you will then encounter specific challenges that you need to design an architectural solution for, where you will apply architectural tactics to address the challenge.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
I will not go through all of the architectural patterns or the tactics; there are simply too may of them, it will simply be a boring enumeration, and it does not help you understand them. It <i>is</i>, however, good to have an overview of the architectural styles, since these will be your starting point when creating (or approaching an existing) new system. Just as with design patterns, it is good to know their names, roughly how they organise your system, and what problem(s) they address, since this means that you will share a vocabulary with other software developers.
</p>

<div class="tip">
<p>
Study the Architectural Patterns in Buschmann et al. so you have a broad overview of the problems they address and how they are structured.

<h3 id="sec-3-2"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Architecture Tactics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
The architecture tactics are organised in a different way. The classic design patterns and architecture patterns are described with a generic problem, an example, a solution, and a discussion of the solution. Tactics start from the notion of <i>quality attribute scenarios</i>, which is a way to define the parameters of a quality requirement. Consider the example in Figure <a href="#fig:QAScenario">1</a>. In this scenario a user starts a transaction when the system is running as normal. The user expects the transaction to be processed within two seconds on average.
</p>


<div id="fig:QAScenario" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/IQAScenarioExample.png" alt="IQAScenarioExample.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> An example of a Quality Attribute Scenario</p>
</div>

<p>
The next step is to find a tactic that can control the response such that the response measure is achieved. In the example in Figure <a href="#fig:QAScenario">1</a>, how may we ensure that transactions are processed within an average of two seconds? This is a performance issue, so we look in Bass et al. under Chapter 8, &ldquo;Performance&rdquo; and find the tactics listed in Table <a href="#tab:PerfTactics">2</a>. We then choose the tactic(s) that best suit our particular problem.
</p>

<p>
Notice that tactics do not tell you exactly which components are needed, or what responsibilities they should have. Instead they merely discuss the solution, and things to consider when using this particular solution. It is then up to you to define which components you will need to implement the tactic, and where in your overall architecture (e.g. which layers) they fit. Not only does this give you a freedom as software designer, it enabled Bass and his colleagues to discuss and categorise architecture solutions for quality requirements that were traditionally &ldquo;ignored&rdquo; because they could not be expressed as a set of interacting components.

<p>
One part of architecture patterns which I have not mentioned yet is that just as there are basic design principles for object oriented designs, there are also good practices for architectures. C. Larman, <i>Applying UML and Patterns</i>, 3rd Edition summarises a set of these with respect to package design (which is as close to architectures as the Larman book goes). These principles should be applied even when working within a particular architecture pattern or when designing in a particular architecture tactic.

Add and/or revise the following items to your glossary:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Architecture Pattern (also the individual architecture patterns mentioned above)
</li>
<li>Architecture Tactic (also the individual tactics for different quality attributes)

<h3 id="sec-5-2"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Self-Study: Architecture Challenges and Tactics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Study the architecture of a couple of open-source systems in the AOSA-book (<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html">http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html</a>). Identify the main challenges they have with respect to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Modifiability
</li>
<li>Performance
</li>
<li>Testability
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You are free to study any of the systems, but you should be warned that not all of these texts actually describe the architecture of the applications or, if they do, in a way that enables evaluation with respect to quality attributes or tactics. I have previously used the following chapters for similar purposes in software architecture courses:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html">Nginx</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/audacity.html">Audacity</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/graphite.html">Graphite</a>    
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you have identified the main challenges for the system, explore the different architecture tactics that might address the challenges (Unless you have access to the third edition of Bass et al., you may use <a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~matei/EECE417/BASS/ch05.html">The chapter on architectural tactics (Chapter 5) from the Second Edition of Bass, Clements, and Kazman</a>). 
</p>

<p>
How did they decide to address the challenge? Which architecture tactics best correspond to their solution? Exactly how is this tactic instantiated into a workable system architecture?
</p>

<p>
The intention of this self-study task is that by going in one direction (from an already solved solution to a generic tactic) you also get experience in seeing how the other direction (going from the tactic to a workable solution) may be done.

<p>
Explore architectural solutions (in terms of architecture tactics) for your quality attribute scenarios.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tasks:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For each quality attribute scenario, identify which architectural tactics (from Bass et al.) that might help you achieve the desired response measure.
</li>
<li>Explore how you would design the architecture of your system to make use of the identified tactics.
</li>
<li>Also consider what support you would need on the design level (in terms of classes and interactions between classes).

<li>Tactics for Quality Attribute Scenario 1: &lt;quality attribute name&gt;

<p>
For each scenario:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>List and describe the tactics that may be relevant.
</li>
<li>Briefly discuss how you would use the tactic (or why you decide <i>not</i> to use this particular tactic).
</li>
<li>Identify key components and classes in your design that are affected by applying your selected tactics.

<li>Updated Architecture

<p>
Present an updated architecture (with as many views that are necessary) that includes the tactics you decided to use. Try to mark, in your architecture, which entities are involved in each tactic, and the responsibilities the entity have in relation to the tactic.

<p>
When marking this part of the assignment we are looking for the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="0">Does the title page contain a table with authors and author contribution?
</li>
<li>Size of assignment: Are two to three tactics explored for each of the five quality attribute scenarios?
</li>
<li>Will the discussed tactics address the challenges in each quality attribute scenario?
</li>
<li>Are the tactics adequately translated into a workable architecture and design for the particular system?
</li>
<li>Does the updated architecture have a reasonable potential to address the quality attribute scenarios?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This sprint, and the previous, describes a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; approach to creating an architecture. By this I mean that you start with the problem and then you create an overall architecture, and then (theoretically) you continue by doing detailed design (e.g. with the help of RUP/UML) inside each component or module. How would this fit into a workflow that is primarily based on RUP/UML, which can be described as a more &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach?

<p>
Are there any other questions that you want answered? Add them, along with a brief strategy for how to find an answer.
